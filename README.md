Unfinished Gameboy Emulator for SmileBASIC

It can play some ROMs at an unplayably slow speed

Use SmileBASIC File Manager to transfer this file and your legally made ROMs which you obtained legally.


Button input is super wack: essentially, the last button that was pressed is registered as being held down so that the emulator actually recognizes your pressing a button.

XY are the start and select button respectively.

Hold the L button to slow down the execution of opcodes and get some debug info on the bottom screen.

All games take lots of time to run before seeing anything visually.
